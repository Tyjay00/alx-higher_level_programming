#Python - Classes and Objects


In this project, I delved into the foundational concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) with a focus on classes and objects in Python. These concepts are crucial for organizing and structuring code in a way that mirrors real-world entities and their interactions. Throughout the project, you gained a deeper understanding of the following key OOP principles:

1. Classes and Objects
You learned how to create and define classes, which serve as blueprints or templates for creating objects. Classes encapsulate both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).
Objects are instances of classes, allowing you to work with and manipulate data in a more organized and intuitive manner.
2. Attributes
You explored the concept of attributes, which are variables associated with a class or object. These attributes define the state or characteristics of the objects created from the class.
3. Methods
Methods are functions associated with a class or object. They define the behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform. You learned how to create and use methods to interact with objects.
4. Properties
Properties provide a way to access and modify the attributes of an object in a controlled manner. You discovered how to use property getters and setters to enforce data validation and encapsulation.
5. Data Abstraction
You explored the idea of data abstraction, which involves hiding the complex implementation details of a class and exposing only the essential features to users. This helps simplify code and enhances usability.
6. Data Encapsulation
Data encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It helps protect the integrity of data by restricting direct access to attributes.
7. Information Hiding
Information hiding is a principle of OOP that emphasizes restricting access to certain attributes or methods to prevent unintended modifications or misuse. You learned how to use access modifiers (e.g., private attributes) to achieve information hiding.
Through practical exercises and coding tasks, you gained hands-on experience in applying these OOP concepts in Python. This project laid a solid foundation for building more complex and structured Python applications using OOP principles.
